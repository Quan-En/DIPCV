# DIPCV (Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision)
In this website, the related methods of Image Processing and Computer Vision are implemented using Python, and some methods are packaged in a GUI.
Mainly can be divided into assignment1 to assignment5 and final project.
A brief description is listed below: 
## Assignment1
Implement : 
- Image transformation : log, gamma, negative
- Resize : bilinear, nearest neighbor

## Assignment2
Implement : image convolution filter
- Blur : Gaussian, averaging
- Edge enhancement : Unsharp mask(with Gaussian blur)
- Edge detection : Laplacian, Sobel
- Denoising : Median, Bilateral, NonLocal Means(NLM)

## Assignment3
Frequency analysis and Restoration
Implement : 
- Frequency transform : (inverse) fast fourier transform (FFT, IFFT), (inverse) fast cosine transform (FCT, IFCT)
- Low-pass filter : Ideal low-pass filter, Gaussian low-pass filter
- High-pass filter : Ideal high-pass filter, Butterworth high-pass filter
- Denoising filter : Inverse filter, Wiener filter, Guided filter

## Assignment4

JPEG Compression

## Assignment5

Homograph Estimation and Correspondence

## Final project

DeepFake detection of Compression Image
